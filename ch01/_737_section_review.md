## 1.
> Explain why overflow cannot occur when the MUL and one-operand IMUL instructions execute.

hello there
'''

## 2.
> How is the one-operand IMUL instruction different from the MUL in the way it generates a multiplication product?

## 3.
> What has to happen in order for the one-operand IMUL to set the Carry and Overflow flags?

## 4.
> When EBX is the operand in a DIV instruction, which register holds the quotient?

## 5. 
> When BX is the operand in a DIV instruction, which register holds the quotient?

## 6.
> When BL is the operand in a MUL instruction, which registers hold the product?

## 7.
> Show an example of sign extension before calling the IDIV instruction with a 16-bit operand.
